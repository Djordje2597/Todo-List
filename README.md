ToDo List by Djordje (That's mee xD)
Domain for my todo app is :

https://todolistbydjordje.netlify.app/

Check it out, I hope you'll like it.

To make a similar app as mine, you need a basic understanding of HTML ,CSS and JavaScript
You can seek knowledge anywhere on the internet. I would recommend Udemy.com, valuable resources for learning programming can be found there.

About my list
At the top of my list, the exact date and time will be displayed to you.
The list will serve as a reminder of some plans you've envisioned and written down or as a reminder of you daily tasks. You can also use it as a list of groceries you want to buy at your store.
After entering the data , you will have the option to edit or delete
You will have option of "clear everything" but if there is nothing to clear you'll get a message.
All the things you put in here will be saved in Local Storage but if you delete it you will delete it from Local Storage also.
You can check this on my Github acc and maybe find something more interesting
